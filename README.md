# CMS-Web-APP

## COVID-19 Solution for Shops and Malls 
This Project is basic CMS(Content Management System) software for
COVID-19 time that uses a database to store the persistent state of the
customers in the real time in any shop or store.
# Purpose
Once a customer came into the store, owner can fill the data like name,
phone, temperature and entry time to track the customers information.
Later on owner can search the customer by his phone or Unique ID to
get the data if any incident happened in the Store. There is also a time
limit feature for every customer for Security purpose.

### Problem in Persistence State 
	1. Files in Local PC:
		Challenge: Unstructured Storage
				   Hence, write operations for update and delete some information in file becomes challenging
				   Security is a big concern
	2. DataBase:
				   Which stores the data permanently
				   Database is structured i.e. we have a way to store and manage data
				   Secure as we need to access DB with username and password
				   I have used MySQL DB	-> Oracle
I am developing the Application Software as well as Web App for the Solution.
#### Thanks!!
